# Ecommerce website (Real is Rare Apparel)
My very first official ecommerce website for a South Arfican clothing brand. The purpose of this website is to promote the local business while i also take this as an opportunity an opportunity to showcase my skills as an upcoming web developer.

<p>The <b>Home.html</b> is the homepage of the website, linked to the <b>support.css</b> css file which controls its styling<p>

<p>The <b>gallery.html</b> contains the products images of the store, where viewers are directed to by the <b>Home.html</b>. The gallery is linked to <b>products.css</b> which contols the layout of the gallery. It is also linked to <b>lightbox.css and lightbox-plus-jquery.js</b> which play a crucial part in the veiwing of a selected image.</p>
